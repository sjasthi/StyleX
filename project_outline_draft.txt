=============== FP 5 ==================
externlize the prompt  (prompt.txt)

[1] prompt 1 that spans across mutiple lines

[2] Can you generate an image of Neil Armstrong based on Picasso Style?
ENsure that Armstrong is drinking coffee in space

[3] Prompt 3 : is a paragraph of text



Your python code relies on "style" directory and this prompt.txt to generate multiple images in one go.

Make sure that all  of you are in sync and the code is prompted to github main branch.
